# QaMePlease

This tool created to automate process of shipping PRs to QA team.

### How it works

After you initialize process, this tool:
1) forking `develop` branch to `testing`
2) merge all PRs with `testing` label to `testing` branch
3) force push `testing` branch to the origin

That's all, happy coding.
